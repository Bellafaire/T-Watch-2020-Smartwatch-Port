# T-Watch-2020-Smartwatch-Port
This repo is a port of the core functionality of my ESP32 based smartwatch (https://github.com/Bellafaire/ESP32-Smart-Watch) to the TTGO T-Watch 2020. 
This firmware can track the time and date, read android phone notifications, and control spotify all through a companion BLE app installed on an android device.
